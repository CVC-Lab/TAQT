To build:
$ cd $BUILD_DIR
$ cmake $SOURCE_DIR
$ make

BUILD_DIR - a location to place files generated during the build.
            It can be the same as the SOURCE_DIR
SOURCE_DIR - The location of the project's root CMakeLists.txt file.


Once you've built the project, the binary will be in bin/ and any libraries
created during the process will be in lib/.
